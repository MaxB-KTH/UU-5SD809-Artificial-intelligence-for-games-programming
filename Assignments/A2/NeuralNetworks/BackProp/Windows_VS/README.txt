If anyone has problems building a Visual Studio project for assignment A2.1 under Windows, the project files in this folder could be compiled under recent versions of Visual Studio.Instructions:(1) Double-click on NN.sln to open the project. Depending on which version of Visual Studio you have, you may have to click “OK” to convert the project to your selected version.(2) If you have never compiled under Visual Studio before, click on the green “play” button called “Local Windows Debugger” to compile and execute the program.(3) If you are using VS2015, select “Yes”.Done! :-)Note that for measurements, each setting (Hidden Nodes = 2, 3, and 4) has to be executed at least 5 times.Good luck!
